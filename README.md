## The Client

[Cotiss](https://www.cotiss.com/) is built specifically to help organisations be more effective in how they buy & supply goods and services. Theyâ€™re a B2B company that creates software for companies to track their spending and make better business decisions.

## Project Objective

As Cotiss has grown over the years, the need for collecting feedback internally and externally has become a more prominent issue. Cotiss leadership is looking for a simple website where employees can anonymously submit feedback. To encourage employees to share honestly, they want a randomly selected piece of existing feedback to be displayed on the site on each page load.

The UX design is simple; a random piece of feedback displayed on each page load, and a box at the bottom of the page with a submit button to add new feedback to the feedback bank.

## Solution

Basic solution includes

- IAM
- EC2
- Auto Scaling
- DynamoDB
- Decoupled [Front End](https://github.com/drenchoman/aws-project-client) built with Svelte
